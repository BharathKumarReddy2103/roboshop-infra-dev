# 🤖 Roboshop Infra- 🚀

Welcome to the **roboshop-infra-** repository. This project provides a robust, production-grade infrastructure setup for the [Roboshop application](https://roboshop.com/)—an e-commerce platform for selling robots—using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) 🛠️. The infrastructure code in this repo is designed to rapidly provision, manage, and scale cloud resources for Roboshop deployments in any environment.

---

## 📖 Background

This infrastructure setup has been **successfully implemented and battle-tested in both my previous and current companies**, ensuring its reliability and adaptability across different organizational environments and requirements.

---

## 🌐 Overview

This repository automates the end-to-end infrastructure required to run the Roboshop application securely and reliably. All resources are defined as code using Terraform, ensuring repeatable, consistent, and auditable infrastructure deployments.

---

## 🏗️ Key Components

- **VPC Creation**: Secure, logically isolated Virtual Private Cloud for application workloads.
- **Security Groups**: Fine-grained access control for all deployed resources 🔒.
- **Bastion Server**: Secure entry point for SSH/RDP access to private resources 🕵️‍♂️.
- **VPN Setup**: Encrypted connectivity for remote access and site-to-site networking 🌍.
- **Database Provisioning**: Automated deployment of scalable databases for the application's backend 🗄️.
- **Backend Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Highly available load balancing for backend services ⚖️.

---

## 🚦 Getting Started
